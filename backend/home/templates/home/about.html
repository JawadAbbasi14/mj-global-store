                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    M-J Store was founded in 2023 by a team of tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs who saw a gap in the e-commerce world.
                    While large platforms dominated the market, independent creators, artisans, and small sellers struggled to stand out
                    and maintain control over their businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We envisioned a fairer, more transparent marketplace ‚Äî one that puts people first. Starting from a small garage office
                    with just three team members and a bold idea, we launched M-J Store as a simple peer-to-peer selling platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, we serve over 500,000 active sellers and 2 million monthly shoppers across 120 countries.
                    Our growth has been fueled not by ads, but by trust, word-of-mouth, and a relentless focus on user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how far we've come, but we're even more excited about where we're going.
