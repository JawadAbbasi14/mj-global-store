## 🤖 Professional Prompt for ChatGPT or AI Tools:

> 🧠 **Prompt:**  
```

Review the structure and README of this repo: [https://github.com/JawadAbbasi14/mj-global-store](https://github.com/JawadAbbasi14/mj-global-store)
Point out gaps in missing files, config problems, or places where a more production-grade setup (e.g., logging, environment configs, Docker, CI/CD) is needed. Give me a prioritized checklist to turn it into a deployable SaaS-level system.

## ⚠️ Current Weaknesses in Repo (Jitni abhi hain):

| Weakness | Suggestion |
|----------|------------|
| ❌ No Django init yet | Run `django-admin startproject core .` inside `/backend` |
| ❌ No `requirements.txt` | Add Python/Django deps file |
| ❌ No `.env` management | Add `python-dotenv` and create `.env.example` |
| ❌ No database schema in `schema.sql` | Add real `CREATE TABLE` statements |
| ❌ No frontend HTML yet | Add `index.html` with basic layout |
| ❌ No deployment script in `install.sh` | Add bash logic for installing dependencies |
